# Bike-Sharing
The objective of this project is to explore the bike sharing data and built a model that can accurately predict the number of bikes rented in a given hour.

This project uses several data analysis techniques such as exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection. The project also uses several Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn.

The Jupyter Notebook contains detailed explanations and comments for every step of the analysis. Feel free to modify or extend the project as you wish.
